# Jamsocket Deploy Action ðŸš€

Automatically deploy session backend code to your Jamsocket service.

## Configuration

To use this Jamsocket deploy action, add the action to your [Github Workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/creating-starter-workflows-for-your-organization#creating-a-starter-workflow).

Here's an example of an action that will run whenever code is pushed to `main`. This action would live under the `.github/workflows` folder.

```yaml
name: Deploy to Jamsocket
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Deploy to Jamsocket
        uses: jamsocket/jamsocket-deploy-action@v0.1.0
        with:
          jamsocket_api_token: ${{ secrets.JAMSOCKET_API_TOKEN }}
          jamsocket_account: my-jamsocket-account
          jamsocket_service: my-jamsocket-service
          docker_build_context: ./server
          dockerfile_path: ./server/Dockerfile
```
